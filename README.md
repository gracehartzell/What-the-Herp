# What the Herp? 

This is my first quarter project for Galvanize! It's a site that you can visit to check out your favorite (or least favorite) reptiles and amphibians. 

**To View:** 
* Visit the site [here]: https://whattheherp.surge.sh.
* Fork and clone. For this, you'll need to run a simple server: 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
After that, you'll visit localhost:8000 to start perusing.




*Note:* You will need to enable your location in order to see the map.


**GETTING STARTED:**
You can start out on the home page (index) and either use the menu in the upper left corner to pick your next location, or you can go to the icons at the bottom of the page for the three most beneficial pages.
