                <li>Snakes in or Around Home</li>
                    <li>Leave the snake alone or use a broom or pole to gently push it towards an exit. If you are confident that you can pick up the snake safely, get a towel or gloves and move it to a new place. You can also call a professional to come remove it for you. Please don't kill it just because you're afraid of it. Think of it as someone's child that has somehow ended up in your house and is terrified. You wouldn't kill it, would you?</li>

                <p>Contact the Humane Society or call 311 to submit a report. Don't move the animal unless it is in danger of being injured further and it is safe for you to do so. </p>

        <h1>Snake Specific</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What to do if a snake attacks you?</strong></li>
                <p>It didn't. You provoked it and it defended itself. Also take a peek at the snake if you can so that you can help medical professionals assess the potential risk from the bite.</p>
                <li><strong>A venomous snake bit me, am I going to die?</strong></li>
                <p>Probably not, but you should still take all preventative measures to mitigate potential damages. The majority of venomous snakes are broken into elapids and vipers.  </p>
                <li><strong>What snakes live in my state?</strong></li>
                <p>There's a nice little map located <a href="http://cobras.org/u-s-interactive-north-american-snakes-map/">here</a> that lets you click on a state and see what snakes live in it and gives you some information on those particular snakes. Pretty neat!</p>
