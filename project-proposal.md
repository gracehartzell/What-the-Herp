## Project Description
This project will provide a platform for search and identification of reptiles as well as a way to engage with peers either on an academic or interest-based level. 


## What problem does your project solve?
There is a dearth of easily accessible information on where to find and learn about herps. Information that is out there is not always as easy to find for people who aren't already familiar with the field of herpetology. This project will 

## Who has this problem?
This problem is dual-pronged: researchers and hobbyists, as well as people who are simply trying to avoid areas where herp sightings are prevalent or find out what a particular creature they stumble upon is.


## How will your project solve this problem?
This project would not only help researchers track and store data, but also enable layfolk to conveniently identify a snake to either learn about it or note the location for others. The latter would integrate with Maps and could give a warning of sorts to people going outdoors who want to avoid potential interaction with snakes.

## What inputs does it need?
User searches for identification, photo uploads and matching, map input for tagging.

## What outputs does it produce?
Populated map, search results including images, specific information, meetups and groups. Visually pleasing images of slithery, slimey creatures. Lots of alliteration and puns.


## What web API(s) will it use?
The Herp Mapper API, possibly Flickr and/or Google for image searches, Google/Facebook/Meetup for locating nearby herpetology groups/events, 

## What technologies do you plan to use?
I'd definitely like to use React, Anime, Firebase and Buzz. More will arise once I start fleshing out everything.

## Feature list
Super sweet pics of all the herps, user interactivity, populated maps, detailed information about herps, meetup/society identifiers for getting friends.
