            <h1>What is Herpetology?</h1>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>In short,  <strong>herpetology is the study of reptiles and amphibians</strong>. It is multidisciplinary that branches into behavior, ecology, physiology, anatomy, paleontology, taxonomy, and more. The bulk of the more technical research is done at universities and museums but generally starts out in the field. Amateurs are responsible for a large number of contributions in areas like distribution, behavior, and taxonomy. Research into the biology of different amphibians and reptiles has contributed much to the field of general biology as for example, larval frogs and salamanders in the understanding of embryological concepts, iguanid lizards with the development of the subdiscipline of population ecology, and snake venom in increasing the understanding of human cardiac and neurological disorders. </li>

                    <li><strong>What to do if a snake attacks you?</strong></li>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, snakes will not seek you out and attack you. Like any wild animal, you should not approach an individual unless you are a professional or skilled person.</p>
                    <li><strong>What to do if you do happen to get bit?</strong></li>
                    <p>First and foremost, <strong>stay calm</strong>. If the snake does happen to be venomous, the last thing you want is for your heart to start pumping faster because that aids in the spread of venom. <strong> Sneak a peek:</strong> Try to get a look at the creature that bit you in order to help professionals <strong>Slink if off:</strong> Remove jewelry or any restrictive items from the area and reduce movement as much as possible. <strong>Seek help: </strong>Seek medical attention and reflect on what you did to make a snake bite you. </p>
